# WuzzufWebScraping
The Wuzzuf Web Scraping project is a small Python application that allows users to search for job titles on the Wuzzuf job portal. By entering a query for the desired job title, the program scrapes the website and retrieves the relevant job results. Users can view the job details on the console, and if desired, save the results to an Excel file on their device for further analysis or reference. The project provides a simple and convenient way to gather job information from Wuzzuf programmatically.
